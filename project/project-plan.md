# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Climate Change: 
Analysis of the effect of forest and land areas on global temperature change and global warming

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
How do changes in forest and land cover affect global temperature changes and global Earth warming?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The aim of this project is to use advanced data engineering methods to investigate the relationship between forest areas, land carbon storage and global temperature changes, by analyzing datasets that include annual surface temperature changes and forest and carbon metrics in different countries.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Annual Surface Temperature Change
* Metadata URL: https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/4063314923d74187be9596f10d034914/explore
* Data URL: https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/4063314923d74187be9596f10d034914_0.csv
* Data Type: CSV

This indicator presents the mean surface temperature change during the period 1961-2021, using temperatures between 1951 and 1980 as a baseline. Use the drop-down menus to search for temperature changes by country.
This data is provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT) and is based on publicly available GISTEMP data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Institute for Space Studies (NASA GISS).
Annual estimates of mean surface temperature change measured with respect to a baseline climatology, corresponding to the period 1951-1980.

### Datasource2: Forest and Carbon
* Metadata URL: https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/66dad9817da847b385d3b2323ce1be57/explore
* Data URL: https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/66dad9817da847b385d3b2323ce1be57_0.csv
* Data Type: CSV

Forests contain the largest stock of land-based carbon. Changes in forests, both in their extent and condition, can lead to low carbon storage and result in faster global warming. Indices on the extent of forests and carbon stored in forests provide a high-level summary of the state of forests across countries.
