# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Investigating Trends in Average Earth Tempreture

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
How has the average Earth temperature changed over time?
What information can be obtained from these trends about climate change?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The goal of this project is to use advanced data engineering methods to investigete the average Earth tempreture trends by analysing datasets of average Earth temperatures.
The datasets in this project will be first cleaned and preprocessed, so that they can be analysed and answer the questions raised by the project.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->
